THE PRODUCTIVE UI FRAMEWORK FOR JAVA WEB APPS

# Spring
Reactive Spring represents a platform wide initiative to deliver reactive support at every level of the development stackâ€”web, security, data, messaging, etc.

# Hibernate
Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for JAVA. It is an open source persistent framework created by Gavin King in 2001. It is a powerful, high performance Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for any Java Application.<br/>

Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and from Java data types to SQL data types and relieves the developer from 95% of common data persistence related programming tasks.<br/>

Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns.<br/>
